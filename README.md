## 👋 Hi, I'm Ernesto

🎓 I'm a Mechanical Engineering student specializing in **Energy and Environmental Systems** at the University of Naples Federico II.  
I'm currently working on my **Master's thesis and internship** focused on **Energy Hub optimization** through **AI and Machine Learning**, applied both to **energy forecasting** and **operational optimization**.

---

## ⚙️ What I’m Working On
- Developing **GAMS-based Energy Hub optimization models**, integrating CHP, boilers, chillers, and storage systems  
- Exploring **AI-driven forecasting techniques** (LSTM, regression models) to enhance energy scheduling accuracy  
- Studying large-scale **energy systems, their operation, management, and optimization strategies**  
- Expanding my technical skills in **GAMS**, **Python**, and hybrid **MILP–AI modeling frameworks**

---

## 💡 Academic & Technical Background
I have participated in several academic projects involving **TRNSYS** for building energy simulations and **MATLAB** for system modeling and control.  
Currently, my focus is on **GAMS** for optimization and **Python** for data analysis and AI-based decision-making.

By the end of my degree (expected **March 2026**), I aim to master both **Python and GAMS** as core professional tools for energy system design and optimization.

## 🏎️ Engineering Experience
I was part of **UniNaCorse**, the official **Formula SAE racing team** of the University of Naples Federico II, where engineering students design, build, and race a single-seater prototype.  
This experience strengthened my **hands-on engineering mindset** — I’m not only someone who codes and optimizes systems, but also someone who understands how machines behave in real conditions and isn’t afraid to get my hands dirty to solve problems.

## 🌍 Professional Aspirations
I’m deeply passionate about **large-scale energy systems**, their **construction, operation, and optimization**.  
My goal is to contribute to the **energy transition and digitalization** process by joining leading global companies such as **Amazon, Meta, ENI, Enel**, or any organization that values advanced **energy management and optimization expertise**.
